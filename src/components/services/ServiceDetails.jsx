              <p>
                We change the image of <i>&apos;play parks&apos;</i> and urban spaces and redefine
                them for all ages. Our main goal is to generate activity landscapes that have a
                meaningful purpose for everyone who steps in them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using an innovative and bespoke design, we create environments full of opportunities
                for play rather than prescribe specific movements or actions. Our models become
                liminal spaces in which different disciplines and activities co-exist - this fuels
                imagination and encourage discoveries from the users.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, we bring together the best aspects of accessible play spaces such as parkour
                parks, callisthenics arenas, and play spaces. We then unite them with an aesthetic
                inspired by sculptures and art that have transcended their primary function, into
                multifunctional spaces.

                Our team works across a breadth of performance types to put on unique
                parkour-centric spectacles and events for the public. Our service includes
                management, project delivery, and providing coaches and performers - Ukemi delivers
                the full package for your event.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notably, we programmed, managed, and delivered Scotland&apos;s largest parkour
                event, as well as produced our show &quot;SHINE&quot; performed by our in-house
                performance team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding your options when managing a parkour event can have benefits for both
                you and the community. In recent years parkour has grown massively and will continue
                to do so. Whether you regard it as a sport, an art form, lifestyle, philosophy, or
                all of those above, we have benefited as a community by finding more than one way to
                share it.
