			<p>
				Ukemi promote activity in highly urbanised areas and encourage a healthier society through digital
				design, product creation, and community arts development. Each company member has practised Parkour for
				over a decade and this is the lens in which we see the world and project our ideas onto. We create
				experiences in response to and in collaboration with communities to reclaim the city for free and open
				activity. Our aim is to tackle health and safety culture to encourage play and demystify fitness and
				movement to make it more accessible through our products and services.
