objective: Currently, we are not able to automatically migrate existing media from
  a git repo to a user’s AWS S3 Bucket. We recommend logging in to your AWS console,
  select your Bucket and bulk upload your images there. After the images are in your
  Bucket, they will also appear in your Media Library in Forestry.
