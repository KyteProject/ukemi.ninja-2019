objective: The Youth Urban Games was a Scottish festival celebrating urban sports
  and community. Our job was to design and manage a parkour charity event. This included
  a  performance, coaching, and non-destructive competition.
brief: |-
  Understanding the options you have when managing a [parkour](https://ukemi.ninja/blog/tag/parkour/) [event](https://ukemi.ninja/blog/tag/event/) can have benefits for both the client and the community. In recent years parkour has grown massively and will continue to do so. Whether you regard it as a sport, an art form, lifestyle, philosophy, performance skill or all of the aforementioned we have benefited as a community by finding more than one way to share it. As a result, we ultimately receive it in many different ways too.

  _Often these come in two categories;_

  1. **Activities that primarily benefit the participant – jams, classes, seminars, and gatherings.**
  2. **Activities that primarily benefit the viewer – computer games, tv, performances, and competitions.**

  When approached to run a parkour competition we began by contacting community leaders for feedback. Expectantly we quickly found that running a competition would be extremely divisive and needed to come up with a solution. We decided to attempt including every activity in _category 1_ and the live elements from _category 2_. Our goal was to create something that would benefit the community, satisfy an audience and fulfil our client’s aims.

  _These requirements gave us three distinct challenges;_

  1. **Running a parkour event for an audience without making it competitive.**
  2. **Creating a spectator event that benefits the community.**
  3. **Presenting classes and jams to a crowd.**
