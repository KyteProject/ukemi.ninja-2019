brief: |-
  The [Movement Card](https://mvmnt-card.com/) aims to educate and inform all who have interactions with people moving in the public domain. Whether that’s you, your friends, the security guard, or even a police officer – with a Movement Card, you have an instant educational resource at your fingertips.

  The goal is to collaborate with communities to replicate the card in other countries worldwide, enabling everybody to know their ‘right to their city’.

  It allows those with limited rights to take legislative examples from other countries for use as a starting point to improve their freedom of movement.

  You can learn more about the Movement Card and find out how to get involved by visiting our site, reading our blog or joining the Movement Card Discord community.
