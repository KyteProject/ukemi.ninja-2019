brief: |-
  The [Movement Card](https://mvmnt-card.com/) aims to educate and inform all who have interactions with people moving in the public domain. Whether that’s you, your friends, the security guard, or even a police officer – with a Movement Card, you have an instant educational resource at your fingertips.

  The Movement Card was initially conceptualised and scratched while collaborating with [Paul Sayer](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paul-sayer-21ba62a2) as part of the former Many Movements collective in 2014. From there we worked in collaboration with [Access Parkour](https://www.facebook.com/accessparkour) members John Hall and [Edinburgh Parkour](https://www.facebook.com/EdinburghParkour) member Gordon Tsang to create the handy pocket-sized card that details a few basics in regards to your right to practice.

  Move forward a few years to 2019 and [Ukemi](https://www.davidbanksartist.com/ukemi) revitalised the project in partnership with [Parkour Outreach](https://www.facebook.com/ParkourOutreach) and opened it up into a worldwide project. The current goal for the Movement Card project is to create a database that details your right to the city in every country on the planet. To see our progress visit the Movement Card site by clicking [here](https://mvmnt-card.com/).

  The goal is to collaborate with communities to replicate the card in other countries worldwide, enabling everybody to know their ‘right to their city’.

  It allows those with limited rights to take legislative examples from other countries for use as a starting point to improve their freedom of movement.

  You can learn more about the Movement Card and find out how to get involved by visiting our site, reading our blog or joining the Movement Card Discord community.
