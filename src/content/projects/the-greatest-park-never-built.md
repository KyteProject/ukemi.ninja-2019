brief: |-
  The Greatest Park Never Built (GPNB) is an online resource that allows users to upload and download designs of environments (training spots, sculpture art, and more) adopted by urban sports communities. Starting with Scotland, we aim to create an online library to provide access to the of the best and most renowned urban sports locations - integrating visions of the city from movers worldwide.

  Like all shifting sites, particularly those in or near the centre of a city, there is no guarantee of how long it will stay the same before changing into something new. Parkour, along with all urban sports, does not have an equal stake in a site that others do. Usage of a place for free and open activity often comes second to developers whose aim is to seek profit and capitalise on the space.

  Our goals are to safeguard these locations for future design implementation, so that aspect of our culture is not lost. We aim to create an interactive resource that acts as a hotbed for sharing designs and create innovation/discussion. Highlighting these communities and providing legacy by creating a visual library of historic spaces used for movement and play.
