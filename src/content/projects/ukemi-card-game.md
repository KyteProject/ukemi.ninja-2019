brief: |-
  Ukemi is a random chance movement game that improves the player's ability to assess risk and develop quality movement. The base movements are derived from the disciplines of parkour, freerunning and broader movement culture. The game works best with 2-4 people.

  **CONTENTS**

  * 30 Movement Cards - These are the cards with the movements and tricks you perform.
  * 20 Condition Cards - These are modifier cards that attach a condition to a movement.
  * 20 Wild Cards - These cards are like condition cards but they are harder and more unusual.
  * 12 Blank Cards - These are blank cards for you to write on.
  * 2 Info Cards - These are for information, they do not play a part in the game.
