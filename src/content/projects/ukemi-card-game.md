brief: |-
  Ukemi is the worldâ€™s first freerunning card game. It is a random chance movement game that improves the player's ability to assess risk and develop quality movement. The base movements are derived from the disciplines of parkour, freerunning and broader movement culture.

  The card game was created as a team with my company [Ukemi](https://ukemi.ninja). It was crowdfunded using the [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com) platform in 2018 and has since been sold to traceurs in over 25 different countries!
